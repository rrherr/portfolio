# Ryan Herr

I'm a machine learning engineer and [banjo player](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAwif0tmlJfUaGjOkqTl5RNJQLJH3798I) from Normal, Illinois. Ever since I first programmed LOGO turtles on an Apple IIe, I've loved mixing code, math, and art in interactive environments.

[I teach data science](https://youtu.be/ITypFgnIiRQ) at Lambda School. I'm interested in how software can give creative feedback to help learners practice new skills.
